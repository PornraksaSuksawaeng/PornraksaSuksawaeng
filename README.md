## About Me

My name is Pornraksa, and I am a Bachelor of Computer Science student at EPITECH, based on the Montpellier campus in France.

I’m passionate about Big Data, Mathematics, Artificial Intelligence, Data Engineering, Data Visualisation, and Cloud Technologies.  
I enjoy exploring how data flows through systems, transforming it into insights, and building scalable architectures.

I’m currently developing my skills across these domains through academic projects, personal experimentation, and continuous learning.
